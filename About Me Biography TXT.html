<p> <font size="5"> To begin one of my favorite hobbies is practicing the drums . I believe that with more practice I could become a pretty decent drum player although that is not the longterm goal . I have also branched out in many other instruments such as piano and electric/acoustic guitar . It's a work in progress but I hope to be able to complete a full song without messing up by the end of this year to show my parents of what I have accomplished since getting the drums .So far I have just been practicing with my older brother who is pretty good on the piano and we play songs together which helps me get better and playing songs .I would also like to try out other instruments like the violin or the bass or maybe just try out every single instrument because I just enjoy playing instruments . </p> 
<p> <font size="5"> Lastly one of my other favorite hobbies is also working in tv helping out with the audio and streaming it live . I started when I was 13 and have kept going and now I'm 15 and have been helping out since then . It is very exciting being behind the conrols but could be very nerveracking when your left by yourself but I think that I'm have gotten better when I'm underpressure . Working in that specific area has taught me a lot on how to adjust audio and how to set up a stream for it to go live . </p>
